# Analysis of Transportation and Fuel Efficiency

This project analyzes how various factors influence vehicle fuel efficiency using data from the U.S. Department of Energy. Statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and ANOVA, were used to explore relationships between vehicle attributes and their fuel economy.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Understand the factors affecting vehicle fuel efficiency to support environmental sustainability and policy development.
- **Dataset:** 2024 vehicle data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Fuel Economy website.
- **Statistical Methods Used:**
  - Hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).
  - Linear regression models.
  - Non-parametric tests (e.g., Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test).
  - Chi-Square tests.

## Features
- Analysis of City, Highway, and Combined Fuel Efficiency.
- Visualization of relationships between vehicle attributes (e.g., engine displacement) and fuel efficiency.
- Insights into significant factors influencing fuel economy.

## Results
- Significant differences in fuel efficiency were found across vehicle divisions.
- A strong negative correlation was observed between engine displacement and fuel efficiency.
- Insights can guide manufacturers and policymakers to improve fuel economy and reduce environmental impact.
